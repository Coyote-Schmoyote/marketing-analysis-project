        "\n",
        "#### Problem 2\n",

        "#### Problem 3 \n",
        "Construct a forecasting model with y (apply for deposit or not apply for deposit) as the objective variable. Try several models (logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, k-NN, random forest, etc.). However, please remove the data in advance for testing (set the traln test splt parameter to random_state=0). Then validate each model. Display the percentage of correct answers, goodness of fit, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix for each model on the test data. \n",
